## What's for?

the DUS is designed to help delegates share their income with voters.
Beforehand, the delegate chooses these redistribution criteria on the mobile APP menu "Delegate Setting"
The wallet calculated according to the delegate's criteria

## What's beneficiary wallet?

In the redistribution criteria there is a beneficiary wallet.
This wallet is different from the delegate wallet:
If the delegate chooses who will redistribute 80% of his income.
The due will calculate that the beneficiary wallet will receive 20% of the delegate's income.

## Why some accounts is exclude from the distribution?

The delegate can choose to exclude voters with a low balance from the redistribution to limit the dilution of income generated by transaction fees
If the chosen delegate excludes the accounts which have a too low balance, the DUS excludes them from the redistribution.the votes count for the delegate but the DUS excludes them from the redistribution.
